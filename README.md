## Installation
- Install Tempermonkey for [firefox](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=firefox) or [chrome](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome)
- open the soundcloud_extentions.user.js file in raw mode (or click [here](https://github.com/xerg0n/soundcloud_extentions/raw/master/soundcloud_extentions.user.js))
- confirm installation

## Usage
- search song
- the top bar should show a "sort by likes" button
- (optional) click the autoscroll button to preload some songs then can then be sorted




## Features
- sort by Likes
- sort by Repots 
- Autoscroll to bottom a couple of times to preload songs in the UI

## Limitations
- Only the visible DOM will be sorted, so the songs have to be loaded to be sorted. For this reason the autoscroll button exists
- Only works on the soundcloud search page so far (no artist pages)
- the playlist will remain unchanged

## Plannes Features
* sort any page
* filter reposts on Feed page
